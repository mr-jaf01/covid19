            <div class="row justify-content-center">

                <h4>What is COVID-19?</h4> 
                COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and
                ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
                The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
                Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold. 

              </div>
              <div class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft col-md-4 mb-2  ml-1  alert alert-info" style="border-radius:19px">
               <h4> What are the symptoms of COVID-19? </h4>
                Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause
                pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These symptoms are similar to
                the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing
                is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19
              </div>

              <div class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeftBig col-md-4 alert alert-info" style="border-radius:19px">
             <h4> How does COVID-19 spread? </h4>
                  The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated
                  through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces
                  contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may
                  survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.

               <h4>Who is most at risk?</h4> 
                We are learning more about how COVID-19 affects people every day.  Older people, and people with
                chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, appear to be more at risk of developing
                severe symptoms.  As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is
                possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of
                COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects
                children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical
                conditions.

              <h4>What is the treatment for COVID-19? </h4>
                There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated
                and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are
                several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.

              <div class="animate__animated  animate__fadeInUpBig col-md-4 mb-2 alert alert-success" style="border-radius:19px">
              <h4>How can the spread of COVID-19 be slowed down or prevented?  </h4>
              As with other respiratory infections like the flu or the common cold, public health measures are critical to
                slow the spread of illnesses. Public health measures are everyday preventive actions that include:
                <br>✓ staying home when sick;
                <br>✓ covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Dispose of
                used tissue immediately;
                <br>✓ washing hands often with soap and water; and
                <br>✓ cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects.
                As we learn more about COVID-19 public health officials may recommend additional actions
